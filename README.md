Tools Used Google Chrome: Browser required to run and test the Chrome extension.
Visual Studio Code (VS Code): Code editor used to write and manage the extension files.
Chrome Developer Tools: For debugging the extension, viewing logs, and testing the extension’s behavior.
Chrome Extensions Platform: Provides the APIs (chrome.tabs, chrome.storage) used to monitor and log website activity.
Resources Manifest File (manifest.json): Defines the extension's metadata, permissions, and the services used.
JavaScript Files: background.js: Tracks active tab changes and logs the time spent on each website. popup.js: Displays the stored time data dynamically in the popup.
HTML and CSS: popup.html: Provides the user interface (UI) to display the tracked data. Inline CSS: Styles the popup table for a clean and simple look.

## Libraries
Features Time Tracking: Tracks the total time spent on each domain (e.g., google.com, facebook.com). Updates the time dynamically as users switch or close tabs.
User Interface: Provides a simple popup displaying a table of websites and the time spent on each.

Data Persistence: Stores time data using chrome.storage.local, allowing data to persist across browser sessions.
Dynamic Updates: Automatically logs and updates the time as the user navigates different websites or switches tabs.
Output Popup UI: Displays the tracked time in a tabular format for easy readability. The popup loads dynamically and updates in real-time.
Console Logs: Debugging information is logged in the Chrome Developer Console, showing real-time tracking and updates.
How It Works Background Script: Listens to tab activation (chrome.tabs.onActivated) and URL changes (chrome.tabs.onUpdated). Tracks the active website and calculates the time spent using timestamps. Stores the time data in Chrome’s local storage. Popup Script: Fetches stored time data from local storage. Dynamically updates the popup table to display the websites and their corresponding time spent.
Extension Interface: Users can click the extension icon in the toolbar to view the tracked time in the popup. Possible Enhancements
Advanced Features: Add daily/weekly reports of website usage. Include a reset button in the popup to clear time data.
